- For a good theme you will need a lockscreen image and 10 page images. these need to ideally be 16:9 (widescreen) so theres less chance of the image stretching. you can find online tools and free apps if you need to edit / crop your images..
- You can use a YouTube to MP3 downloader / converter, or any other method to get an MP3 background audio that will go well with your theme..
- Optionally you can change the notification bubble so you would also need a smaller image (or 2, once for each state). If you decide to not change this, the default PS logo will be used..
- Finally you ideally need either a universal texture image to use for all the icons, or 17 individiual images / textures for each of the system icons. you can use the builder to make basic icon sets or leave the Vita default icons (which is a litte boring)
